    "### Use of seeds\n",
    "This makes your program’s “random” results repeatable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use functions like random.shuffle() or random.randint(), they generate different results every time you run the program.\n",
    "But by setting a seed, you “lock in” the randomness — meaning if you run your program again, you’ll get the exact same random results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it’s important here\n",
    "Since the algorithm forms teams randomly with logic, you want to be able to re-run and debug your code with the same results — for fairness, consistency, and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I/O file names\n",
    "INPUT_CSV: where your student records are stored (given to you)\n",
    "OIUTPOUT_CSV: the new file your program will create after forming teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Team size\n",
    "This defines how many students go into each team.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Swap iterations\n",
    "When the algorithm is trying to optimize teams (e.g. swapping members to make teams more balanced/diverse), it doesn’t go on forever.\n",
    "This parameter limits the number of times it can attempt “swaps” or “improvements” inside each tutorial group.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why?\n",
    "Without a limit, your code might keep trying forever to find a perfect team combination (which is almost impossible).\n",
    "This ensures the program stops at a reasonable point — trading off speed vs. quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Penalty weight \n",
    "These are “weights” for how much your algorithm “cares” about each type of diversity when forming teams.\n",
    "- SCHOOL_PENALTY_WEIGHT - How heavily to penalize teams that have too many students from the same school.\n",
    "- GENDER_PENALTY_WEIGHT - How heavily to penalize teams that have too many students of the same gender.\n",
    "- CGPA_PENALTY_WEIGHT - How heavily to penalize teams that are unbalanced in academic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why is CGPA lower?\n",
    "It just means it’s harder to perfectly balance compared to school or gender — so the algorithm gives it a softer weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the algorithm will first try to fix school/gender imbalance,\n",
    "and then adjust CGPA as much as possible within that constraint.\n",
    "So it still cares about CGPA — just not at the cost of breaking diversity in gender/school.\n",

    "   5. **Initial assignment: for each bucket (largest first) round-robin assign members to teams, choosing the team that currently minimizes count of same school & gender and has capacity.**\n",
    "   6. **Local improvement: repeatedly pick two random teams and attempt to swap one member between them; accept swap if it reduces the sum of penalties for those two teams. Penalty = large penalty for school majority + large penalty for gender majority + moderate penalty for team CGPA mean deviation from group mean.**\n",
    "   7. **When no improvement or iteration limit reached, finalize teams for the tutorial.**\n",
    "4. **Flatten all teams, add 'Team Assigned' column, and write to output CSV.**"
