120 tutorial groups × 50 students each.


Each team must have 5 students → 10 teams per tutorial group.


Teams must be formed within the same tutorial group (no cross-group mixing).


Teams should be balanced and diverse:


School Affiliation: No majority (≥3) from same school.


Gender: No majority of same gender.


CGPA: Balanced (avoid all high or all low CGPAs)
